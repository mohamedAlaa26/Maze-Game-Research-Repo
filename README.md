# Hand Gesture Classification with Machine Learning

This project implements machine learning models for hand gesture classification. It includes preprocessing of gesture data, model training, and evaluation using techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and XGboost .

The project also incorporates **hyperparameter tuning** using **Optuna** to optimize model performance and achieve the best results.

## Features:
- **Preprocessing** of the Hand Gesture Dataset: Data is cleaned and transformed for better performance in classification.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes SVM, Random Forest, and XGboost for classification tasks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implements Optuna to optimize hyperparameters for each model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using key metrics such as:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **F1-score**

The goal of this project is to classify hand gesture images accurately and efficiently using machine learning techniques, and to showcase the impact of hyperparameter optimization on model performance.
